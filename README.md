## Overview

This project utilizes Support Vector Machines (SVMs), powerful machine learning models capable of creating intricate decision boundaries, to predict the strike zone in baseball. The strike zone is a critical boundary that determines whether a pitch is classified as a strike or a ball. While there is a standardized definition of the strike zone, it can vary depending on factors like the umpire's judgment or the batter's stance.

## Objectives

- Train an SVM model using a baseball dataset to learn and predict the strike zone.
- Explore how SVMs can model complex decision boundaries in the context of baseball pitching.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy in predicting strike zones based on real-game data.

## Dataset

The project uses a comprehensive baseball dataset containing historical data on pitches, including their locations relative to the strike zone and their corresponding classifications (strike or ball).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preparation:** Clean and preprocess the baseball dataset, ensuring it is suitable for SVM training.
   
2. **Model Training:** Utilize SVMs to train a model that learns the decision boundary of the strike zone.

3. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. Validate its ability to predict strike zones effectively.

## Results

- The trained SVM model successfully identifies and maps the decision boundary of the strike zone.
- Comparative analysis against traditional strike zone definitions and real-game scenarios.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate real-time game data for dynamic strike zone prediction.
- Explore other machine learning techniques for strike zone prediction, such as deep learning approaches.
